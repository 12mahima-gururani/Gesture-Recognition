# Gesture-Recognition
The gestures include Thumbs Up (increase volume), Thumbs Down (decrease volume), Left Swipe (jump backward 10 seconds), Right Swipe (jump forward 10 seconds), and Stop (pause the movie). The input for the gesture recognition system is a sequence of 30 frames or images captured by the webcam mounted on the TV.
